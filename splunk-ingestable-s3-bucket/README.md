# S3 bucket with files to be ingested by splunk
This module creates an s3 bucket and other infrastrucutre (SNS, SQS, IAM) that can hold files to be ingested by Splunk using [SQS Based S3 ingestion](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/AWS/SQS-basedS3)

Please Note

* The bucket is created with a lifecycle policy that will, by default, remove items after 7 days. Splunk should be able to ingest the files in that time period 
* All accounts in the Telia organization can Put items in the created bucket, but they have no read access
* One dedicated account have read access to the bucket. This will typically be the AWS account hosting Splunk
* The module provisions SQS and SNS resources and required policies. Attributes of the SQS queue can be overridden by setting variables.
